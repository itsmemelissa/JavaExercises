/*
EXERCISE:
Create a program that asks for results of exams and calculates the mean average of the grades. Grades are floating point numbers between 4 and 10.
Program asks for grades until a negative number is typed. If user gives a grade other than a number between 4 and 10, the text “Invalid grade!” will be
printed on screen and program asks for another grade. Finally the program prints the number of inputted grades and their mean average on screen as shown
in the example print. If no grades were inputted, the notice “You did not input any grades.” is the only thing printed on screen.

Hint:A double type variable is to be used to store the value of the average.
