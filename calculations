/*
EXERCISE:

Create a calculator program which lets the user choose what calculation to perform.
First the program asks what calculation is to be performed.
Then the program asks for two integers, performs the chosen calculation between the given numbers and prints the result on screen.
The choosing of the calculation is to be done using switch statement.
If, when choosing the calculation type, the user input is not a number between 1 and 5, program prints “Invalid choice” and program execution ends.
Hence the user will not be prompted to input two integers if the original calculation choice is not a number between 1 and 5.

Hint:A type conversion must be done when printing the result of a division in order to include the decimal part of the result.
